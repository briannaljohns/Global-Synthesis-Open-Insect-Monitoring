## Key Papers

Created marked list of 7 key papers on open source insect monitoring technologies on Web of Science then exported this list to a RIS file (as full records). These papers act as an “anchor” to the global synthesis, and should appear in the results of a keyword search. If they don’t appear, the keywords need to be reconfigured. RIS file saved as keypapers.ris. Use KeyPaperOverview.R to get info on these papers (titles, abstract, keywords, etc.)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

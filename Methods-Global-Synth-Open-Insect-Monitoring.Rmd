## Key Papers

Created marked list of 7 key papers on open source insect monitoring technologies on Web of Science then exported this list to a RIS file (as full records). These papers act as an “anchor” to the global synthesis, and should appear in the results of a keyword search. If they don’t appear, the keywords need to be reconfigured. RIS file saved as keypapers.ris. Use KeyPaperOverview.R to get info on these papers. I ran the script to see common keywords associated with these articles to refine my search keywords

```{r}
source("KeyPaperOverview.R")
all_terms <- unique(c(keywords, title_terms, abstract))
all_terms
```
